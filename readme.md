proposal for an api to add per-vertex colors and coordinates to love2d

the above features are pretty awesome

it is modeled off spritebatches because it's basically the same thing underneath (vertex arrays/buffers) but is of course much more powerful... at the cost of being more advanced.

NOTE: you need love built with luajit2 (preferably beta 10 or newer) in order to use this library
